# Deep learning fundamental

In the sample `neural_network.ipynb`, you will learn how to implement a simple neural network step by step using python, includes:
- Nerons and network
- Activation function: sigmoid
- Loss function: logloss
- Forward and backward propogation
- Training and predict 

For comparision, the sample `neural_network_pytorch.ipynb` is the PyTorch version of `neural_network.ipynb`
